                    <p class="section-content"> I recently graduated from the Schulich School of Business at York University in June 2019. It was exciting to finally reach this milestone after four years of hard work and learning. I recently took some time to reflect on my undergraduate experience and how it has changd me to the person I am today.

 </p>
                    <p class="section-content"> Here are 3 key lessons I have learned at Schulich that have changed my life and ones that I will continue to take with me during every new experience I take on: </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> A huge part of what made my time at Schulich enjoyable was my friends and classmates. There were many group projects and activties that we collaborated and supported eachother on. I learned the importance of having different perspectives on teams as it allowed us to see the whole picture on various topics.   </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> While I was in school, I was also working part-time in retail and participating in extra-curricular school and community activities. Balancing these aspects of my life were challenging at first but I learned how to prioritize my time by keeping myself organized with an agenda and focusing on my goals.

                        <p class="section-content">I have been grateful to have interned at different companies throughout my time in school. These internships were great as they allowed me to apply what I learned inside the classroom while gaining practical work experience. It also allowed me to discover my own personal strengths and weaknesses and expand my network.
