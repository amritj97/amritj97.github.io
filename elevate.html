                    <p class="section-content"> I was among the 500 students selected as TD NextGen guests at the Elevate Tech Fest that took place in September 2018. Elevate is a multi-day tech and innovation festival which features keynote speakers, content tracks featuring topics such as blockchain technologies, and huge networking opportunities. I had the opportunity to listen to global leaders explore how we can improve the world with technology and even got to ring the TSX bell alongside other TD NextGen guests, Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development) and Tobias Lutke (Shopify Founder & CEO).

                    <p class="section-content"> This was an exciting experience for me as throughout my undergraduate career, I recognized the intersection between business and technology. I learned that business leaders would have to understand the digital space and innovations taking place to work effectively to provide creative solutions to its users. One of the best things about technology is that you can build technology seamlessly, with little investment and test the success using the iterative design approach. Using this approach, product owners are able to track specific key metrics to track the success of the product and use the learnings to improve the experience of the product. This makes it relatively easy to implement technological solutions and learn from the products that are in the market. </p>

                        <p class="section-content">Since I am a business student, topics about innovations in technology are only briefly touched on in classes and do not go into a lot of depth. Elevate was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the digital space but was also a stepping stone for me to learn more. This means attending more workshops hosted by Bitmaker (digital marketing, intro to data analysis)and enrolling in courses on Coursera.

                     <p class="section-content">Technology is moving fast and is continuing to disrupt industries. Companies need to be innovating in order to not be left behind and provide its users with solutions they did not know they needed.
