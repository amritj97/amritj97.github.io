                    <p class="section-content"> I was among the 500 students selected as TD NextGen guests at the Elevate Tech Fest that took place in September 2018. Elevate is a multi-day tech and innovation festival which features keynote speakers, content tracks featuring topics such as blockchain technologies, and huge networking opportunities. I had the opportunity to listen to global leaders explore how we can improve the world with technology and even got to ring the TSX bell alongside other TD NextGen guests, Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development) and Tobias Lutke (Shopify Founder & CEO).

                    <p class="section-content"> This was an exciting experience for me as throughout my undergraduate career, I recognized the intersection between business and technology. I learned that business leaders would have to understand the digital space and innovations taking place to work effectively to provide creative solutions to its users. One of the best things about technology is that you can build technology seamlessly, with little investment and test the success using the iterative design approach. Using this approach, product owners are able to track specific key metrics to track the success of the product and use the learnings to improve the experience of the product. This makes it relatively easy to implement technological solutions and learn from the products that are in the market. </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> Working at Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) was an interesting experience as the company finds itself in an interesting position: it is a crown corporation and is accountable to parliament but it is managed independently and only operates within arm’s length of the Canadian government. However, many Canadians believe that the organization is managed by the Canadian government and that investment decisions are made with a political agenda in mind. With this, CPPIB does a lot of work in branding to try and change the negative perception some Canadians have about the organization. Whenever the company made a decision, they made sure it aligned with their brand and the image they wanted Canadians to see.

                        <p class="section-content"> When it comes to an organization’s branding, there’s a lot more to it than the logo. It’s the way that the organization communicates, both visually and in the written medium, to the intended audience. I learned a lot about the immediate impacts that a brand can have with the consumer base. </p>

                        <p class="section-content">Coming from a business background, there were some aspects of the job I had to learn while I was there. For example, instead of analyzing an investment from a finance standpoint, I would have to look at it through a reputation risk lens and see if it aligned with the company’s mandate. I took the time during my internship to learn about the communications and marketing field and took on initiatives to learn about changes in the industry. 


 
  </p>
                        
                        <p class="section-content"> I learned that there’s incredible value in asking questions, especially as an intern. I had the ability to navigate through the culture at CPPIB by asking questions that helped me understand how CPP assess reputation risk with numbers, how to go about writing great press conferences and what metrics to look at in social media management. All of these skills comes down to asking great questions. </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> One of the things I loved about working at CPPIB was the diverse backgrounds that everyone had. While many had a communications background, others came from the digital space, business and law. It was great working on this team as I believe that everyone’s differentiated experience brought different perspectives to many projects and helped create a stronger team.
